## What does this provide?

[Back to the contents](#contents)

A starter point into the CLI world for node, without some complex frameworks or local/private installations/distributions.
Just some scripting, a couple of `.mjs` files, and even some type safety into it.

This is meant to show the possibilities and provide some pieces of the bigger picture, it is up to you how you put them together

## Configuration and setup

[Back to the contents](#contents)

I'm using `pnpm`, npm or yarn will also do the job.

You don't have to, but typescript is installed, and for the complete run, you'll have to install it, you can do so by:

```bash
pnpm install # or npm or yarn
```

Scripts and entrypoints are executed via `pnpm`, you can replace them, and most can be executed like:

```bash
pnpm run [script] [...args] # or npm or yarn
```
